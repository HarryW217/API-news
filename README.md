If you wish to clone this project and run it locally, you will need to create two .env files to connect each database to a local variable environment: .env.test and .env.development. 

Within each, add PGDATABASE=, and the correct database name for that environment. You can see the database names in /db/setup.sql .

Double check that these .env files are .gitignored , and happy coding!
